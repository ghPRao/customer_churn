# Telecommunication Subsriber Churn Analysis
I have 20 years of strategic marketing background in Telecommunication. When we did the quarterly market insights, we tracked operator  preformance, subscriber counts, subscription vs prepaid, ARPU, etc. for top telecom operators globally. Churn was one of the key indicator to measure the network robostness and services delivered at an attractive price.

So, in this analysis, I will look build many Machine Learning models to analyze subscriber churns.

Dataset selected comes from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/becksddf/churn-in-telecoms-dataset.

Project Goal:
Kaggle data set has customer data from SyriaTel. SyriaTel would want us to predict when a customer will churn.
